Considering that education is one of the most heavily-hit
fields, it is indisputably vital that proper education policies are determined and implemented as part of an effective social state policy. This
study examines the effect of the new Coronavirus on Turkish educational policies. Immediately after the Turkish Ministry of Health announced
that the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in Turkey in March 2020,
the Ministry of Education (MoNE) and the Council of Higher Education
(CoHE) have introduced some new regulations. By applying discourse
analysis, the education discourses regarding these regulations required by
the new Coronavirus will be discussed.
